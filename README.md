# Web Development Challenge

## The Problem: 

Our fake client, ACME Sports, wants to display a dynamic list of NFL teams on a page on its website. It’s dynamic because the site will pull the NFL team data from a remote API that is frequently updated. 

This is ACME Sports’ first website and they don’t understand tech, UX or SEO. So, they are relying on you for all aspects of this initiative – user experience, SEO and technical implementation. 

## Installation

As any regular wordpress plugin, place plugin folder with the source code inside wp-content/plugins
folder on wordpress. Go to the wordpress admin panel and click on the Plugins link in the admin menu, and activate it.

## What this plugin does

This plugin creates a web page showing the NFL Teams data retrieved from the API endpoint URL provided in the documetation of the problem.
